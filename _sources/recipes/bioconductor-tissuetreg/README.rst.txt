The package provides ready to use epigenomes \(obtained from TWGBS\) and transcriptomes \(RNA\-seq\) from various tissues as obtained in the study \(Delacher and Imbusch 2017\, PMID\: 28783152\). Regulatory T cells \(Treg cells\) perform two distinct functions\: they maintain self\-tolerance\, and they support organ homeostasis by differentiating into specialized tissue Treg cells. The underlying dataset characterises the epigenetic and transcriptomic modifications for specialized tissue Treg cells.
