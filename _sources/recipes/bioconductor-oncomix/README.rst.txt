This package helps identify mRNAs that are overexpressed in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue. Ideal inputs would be paired tumor\-normal data from the same tissue from many patients \(\>15 pairs\). This unsupervised approach relies on the observation that oncogenes are characteristically overexpressed in only a subset of tumors in the population\, and may help identify oncogene candidates purely based on differences in mRNA expression between previously unknown subtypes.
