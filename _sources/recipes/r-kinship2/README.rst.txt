Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The initial purpose was to create correlation structures that describe  family relationships such as kinship and identity\-by\-descent\, which can be used to model family data in mixed effects models\, such as in the  coxme function.  Also includes a tool for pedigree drawing which is  focused on producing compact layouts without intervention.  Recent additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria\, and  kinship for the X chromosome.
