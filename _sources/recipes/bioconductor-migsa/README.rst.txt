Massive and Integrative Gene Set Analysis. The MIGSA package allows to perform a massive and integrative gene set analysis over several expression and gene sets simultaneously. It provides a common gene expression analytic framework that grants a comprehensive and coherent analysis. Only a minimal user parameter setting is required to perform both singular and gene set enrichment analyses in an integrative manner by means of the best available methods\, i.e. dEnricher and mGSZ respectively. The greatest strengths of this big omics data tool are the availability of several functions to explore\, analyze and visualize its results in order to facilitate the data mining task over huge information sources. MIGSA package also provides several functions that allow to easily load the most updated gene sets from several repositories.
