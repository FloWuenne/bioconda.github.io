bioconductor-psichomics
=======================

|downloads|

Interactive R package with an intuitive Shiny\-based graphical interface for alternative splicing quantification and integrative analyses of alternative splicing and gene expression based on The Cancer Genome Atlas \(TCGA\)\, the Genotype\-Tissue Expression project \(GTEx\)\, Sequence Read Archive \(SRA\) and user\-provided data. The tool interactively performs survival\, dimensionality reduction and median\- and variance\-based differential splicing and gene expression analyses that benefit from the incorporation of clinical and molecular sample\-associated features \(such as tumour stage or survival\). Interactive visual access to genomic mapping and functional annotation of selected alternative splicing events is also included.
