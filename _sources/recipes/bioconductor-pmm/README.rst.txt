The Parallel Mixed Model \(PMM\) approach is suitable for hit selection and cross\-comparison of RNAi screens generated in experiments that are performed in parallel under several conditions. For example\, we could think of the measurements or readouts from cells under RNAi knock\-down\, which are infected with several pathogens or which are grown from different cell lines.
