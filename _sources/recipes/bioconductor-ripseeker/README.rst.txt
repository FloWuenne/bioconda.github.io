Infer and discriminate RIP peaks from RIP-seq alignments using two-state HMM with negative binomial emission probability. While RIPSeeker is specifically tailored for RIP-seq data analysis, it also provides a suite of bioinformatics tools integrated within this self-contained software package comprehensively addressing issues ranging from post-alignments processing to visualization and annotation.
