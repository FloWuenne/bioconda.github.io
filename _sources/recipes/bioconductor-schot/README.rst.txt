   Single cell Higher Order Testing \(scHOT\) is an R package that facilitates testing changes in higher order structure of gene expression along either a developmental trajectory or across space. scHOT is general and modular in nature\, can be run in multiple data contexts such as along a continuous trajectory\, between discrete groups\, and over spatial orientations\; as well as accommodate any higher order measurement such as variability or correlation. scHOT meaningfully adds to first order effect testing\, such as differential expression\, and provides a framework for interrogating higher order interactions from single cell data.
