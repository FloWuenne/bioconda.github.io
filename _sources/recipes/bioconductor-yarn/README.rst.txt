Expedite large RNA\-Seq analyses using a combination of previously developed tools. YARN is meant to make it easier for the user in performing basic mis\-annotation quality control\, filtering\, and condition\-aware normalization. YARN leverages many Bioconductor tools and statistical techniques to account for the large heterogeneity and sparsity found in very large RNA\-seq experiments.
