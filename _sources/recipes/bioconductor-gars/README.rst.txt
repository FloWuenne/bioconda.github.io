Feature selection aims to identify and remove redundant\, irrelevant and noisy variables from high\-dimensional datasets. Selecting informative features affects the subsequent classification and regression analyses by improving their overall performances. Several methods have been proposed to perform feature selection\: most of them relies on univariate statistics\, correlation\, entropy measurements or the usage of backward\/forward regressions. Herein\, we propose an efficient\, robust and fast method that adopts stochastic optimization approaches for high\-dimensional. GARS is an innovative implementation of a genetic algorithm that selects robust features in high\-dimensional and challenging datasets.
