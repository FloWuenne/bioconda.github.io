Sprai \(single\-pass read accuracy improver\) is a tool to correct sequencing errors in single\-pass reads for de novo assembly\. It is originally designed for correcting sequencing errors in single\-molecule DNA sequencing reads\, especially in Continuous Long Reads \(CLRs\) generated by PacBio RS sequencers\. The goal of Sprai is not maximizing the accuracy of error\-corrected reads\; instead\, Sprai aims at maximizing the continuity \(i\.e\.\, N50 contig length\) of assembled contigs after error correction\.
