This library contains functions that calculate various statistics of differential expression for microarray data\, including t statistics\, fold change\, F statistics\, SAM\, moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also implements a new methodology called DEDS \(Differential Expression via Distance Summary\)\, which selects differentially expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of statistics using a weighted distance approach.
