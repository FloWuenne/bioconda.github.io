Provides an implementation of the framework of reversed graph embedding (RGE) which
projects data into a reduced dimensional space while constructs a principal tree
which passes through the middle of the data simultaneously. DDRTree shows superiority
to alternatives (Wishbone, DPT) for inferring the ordering as well as the intrinsic
structure of the single cell genomics data. In general, it could be used to reconstruct
the temporal progression as well as bifurcation structure of any datatype.
