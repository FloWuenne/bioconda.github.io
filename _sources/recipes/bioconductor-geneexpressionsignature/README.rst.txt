bioconductor-geneexpressionsignature
====================================

|downloads|

This package gives the implementations of the gene expression signature and its distance to each. Gene expression signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. And its distance is defined using a nonparametric\, rank\-based pattern\-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov\-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs\, diseases\, and biological states of interest.
