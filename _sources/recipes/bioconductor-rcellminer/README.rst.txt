The NCI\-60 cancer cell line panel has been used over the course of several decades as an anti\-cancer drug screen. This panel was developed as part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program \(DTP\, http\:\/\/dtp.nci.nih.gov\/\) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute \(NCI\). Thousands of compounds have been tested on the NCI\-60\, which have been extensively characterized by many platforms for gene and protein expression\, copy number\, mutation\, and others \(Reinhold\, et al.\, 2012\). The purpose of the CellMiner project \(http\:\/\/discover.nci.nih.gov\/ cellminer\) has been to integrate data from multiple platforms used to analyze the NCI\-60 and to provide a powerful suite of tools for exploration of NCI\-60 data.
