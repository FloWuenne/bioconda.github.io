Enriched heatmap is a special type of heatmap which visualizes the enrichment of genomic signals on specific target regions. Here we implement enriched heatmap by ComplexHeatmap package. Since this type of heatmap is just a normal heatmap but with some special settings\, with the functionality of ComplexHeatmap\, it would be much easier to customize the heatmap as well as concatenating to a list of heatmaps to show correspondance between different data sources.
