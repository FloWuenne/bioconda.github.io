methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and annotation from high\-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The package is designed to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants\, but also target\-capture methods and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. It also has functions to analyze base\-pair resolution 5hmC data from experimental protocols such as oxBS\-Seq and TAB\-Seq. Perl is needed to read SAM files only.
