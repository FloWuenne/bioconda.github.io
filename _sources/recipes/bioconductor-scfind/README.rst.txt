Recently a very large collection of single\-cell RNA\-seq \(scRNA\-seq\) datasets has been generated and publicly released. For the collection to be useful\, the information must be organized in a way that supports queries that are relevant to researchers. \`scfind\` builds an index from scRNA\-seq datasets which organizes the information in a suitable and compact manner so that the datasets can be very efficiently searched for either cells or cell types in which a given list of genes is expressed.
