gkm\-SVM\, a sequence\-based method for predicting regulatory DNA elements\, is a useful tool for studying gene regulatory mechanisms. In continuous efforts to improve the method\, new software\, LS\-GKM\, is introduced. It offers much better scalability and provides further advanced gapped k\-mer based kernel functions. As a result\, LS\-GKM achieves considerably higher accuracy than the original gkm\-SVM.
