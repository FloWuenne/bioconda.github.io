A method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks \(e.g.\, gene co\-expression networks\)\, which builds on a commonly used association measure\, such as Pearson\'s correlation coefficient. This package includes functions to calculate correlation matrices for high\-dimensional dataset and to test differential correlation\, which means the changes in the correlation relationship among variables \(e.g.\, genes and metabolites\) between 2 experimental conditions.
