 Single\-cell RNA\-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells\, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement of cell\-to\-cell gene expression similarity is critical to identification\, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However\, single\-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise\, outliers and dropouts. We develop a novel similarity\-learning framework\, SIMLR \(Single\-cell Interpretation via Multi\-kernel LeaRning\)\, which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction\, clustering and visualization. SIMLR is capable of separating known subpopulations more accurately in single\-cell data sets than do existing dimension reduction methods. Additionally\, SIMLR demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy on high\-throughput peripheral blood mononuclear cells \(PBMC\) data sets generated by the GemCode single\-cell technology from 10x Genomics.
